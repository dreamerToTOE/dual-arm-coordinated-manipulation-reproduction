Repository initialized. No baseline implementation has started.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TASK00 Environment Audit | PASS | Report: reports/TASK00_ENVIRONMENT.md; external integration gaps identified |
| TASK01 Benchmark Freeze | IN_PROGRESS | Inherited normal-feed physical demo 5/5 PASS, 70,434 valid snapshots; NOT D004/freeze PASS. Required inner side helper pose intersects neighbor (BUG-009). Controlled hold completes but raw wrench/velocity remain uncalibrated (BUG-011). Actual Cube friction=0.5/0.5: declared material deleted by cleanup (BUG-012). 36 nulls, model/protocol review, time/frames and MoveIt teardown remain open; see latest runtime review |
| TASK02 Common Interfaces / Logger / Metrics | TODO | Depends on TASK01 |
| TASK03–06 P4 | TODO | |

## Current gate
**Do not implement paper algorithms yet. Draft and review TASK01 benchmark_v1 first.**

## 2026-10-03 final evidence / review stop

Latest report: `reports/TASK01_RUNTIME_REVIEW_20261003.md`. Actual five-Cube ordinary manipulation works; the additional opt-in hold also resumes and places Cube01 with exit 0. Full-rate static diagnostics expose alternating reaction and tensor/pose finite-difference velocity disagreement; no instantaneous force/internal-wrench PASS. OBB audit proves current Cube04 centered helper tool intersects Cube03. Actual material audit exposes 0.5/0.5 coefficients rather than 0.90/0.75. These need explicit model/contact direction, not silent changes under a persistence request. No YAML/null/hash change, paper implementation or frozen benchmark claim. Six records updated, all owned simulators/controllers stopped; MoveIt teardown still -11.

Further continuation: 24 fixed-center/inward-normal TCP rolls all retain lateral-support/Cube03 intersection. No box-clear rotation-only candidate found, no commands. Final offline Python regression 18/18 PASS; protocol/model review still required.

## 2026-10-03 runtime-repair checkpoint

Bounded fine pre-close correction and Task27 quaternion fix are implemented in legacy branch `task01-runtime-fixes` (`d80b6b6`); unit/build PASS. Fresh normal five-Cube physical regression is running: Cube01 complete and Cube02 pre-close passes unchanged 0.300 mm gate. No final full-flow result yet. Real link8 fixed-joint frame/anchor audit now succeeds; dynamic contact compensation still unvalidated. Legacy first-four push/inner-trim topology also differs from D004 (BUG-009), so even legacy demo completion alone cannot freeze TASK01. YAML remains DRAFT with 36 nulls; TASK02 TODO.

## 2026-10-03 completed legacy-demo checkpoint

Subsequent full run completes all five physical batches, controller exit 0 and both arms HOME. Detailed results/negative prior run remain in TASK01_FULL_FIXTURE_CONTACT_PROBE. Final center errors range 0.574–2.276 mm for the four fixtures; Cube05 controller 0.493 mm / later physical sample 0.563 mm. Rear+side simultaneously CLOSED sample count for first four is zero, so D004 is still unmet. Whole-process pause calibration safely fails on stale ROS state; replacement leaves ROS executor active and uses an explicit optional hold parameter. No benchmark freeze, physics/gate change or paper implementation.
