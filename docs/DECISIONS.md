# DECISIONS

Append-only architectural and scientific decisions.

## D001 — Two-platform strategy
- Date: 2026-09-29
- Decision: Isaac Sim + ROS2 is the final common benchmark; MuJoCo is an auxiliary force/contact laboratory mainly for P2/P3.
- Reason: preserve fair final comparison while accelerating force/contact debugging.
- Impact: baseline algorithms remain platform-independent and use adapters.

## D002 — Baseline-first rule
- Date: 2026-09-29
- Decision: `ours/` remains algorithmically empty until TASK30.
- Reason: derive our method from reproducible evidence and failure cases rather than premature design.
